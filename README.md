# Data-Analysis-Austin-Dog-Parks
## Data Collection and Curation

#### Goal of project:
The goal of this project was to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset. Since there has been a huge increase in hybrid breeding of dogs for non-shedding coats, I was curious about dog ownership and the types of dogs owners had in two area dog parks: Hancock Dog Park and Norwood Estate Dog Park. Through surveying people entering the dog park, questions were asked, and responses recorded.

#### License:
For my data a license was not needed because I collected my own data without using an API.

#### Data type and description for each attribute:
The data type collected through the surveys was Qualitative and both Nominal & Ordinal for certain attributes. Below is a list of the survey questions asked of each dog owner. At the end of each question the possible yes/no response is identified as either nominal or ordinal data.
  1) Is this your only pet? Nominal
  2) Is this your first pet? Nominal
  3) Does the dog live in an apartment or house? Nominal
  4) Dog has more than one owner? Ordinal
  5) Are you in school or not? Nominal
  6) Dog size/under 20 pounds or not? Ordinal
  7) Shedding breed? Nominal
  
The data description for each attribute is whether dog owners answered yes or no to the survey questions, in either Hancock Dog Park or Norwood Estate Dog park. Further clarification on the meaning of each question is described below.
  1) Is this your only pet?
     Asked to find out if respondent has other pets that may influence the type of dog they own.
  2) Is this your first pet?
     Asked because experienced dog owners know about the amount of hair dogs shed.
  3) Does the dog live in an apartment or house?
     Asked because size of residence impacts the amount of area there is to clean for dog hair.
  4) Dog has more than one owner?
     Asked because having multiple owners helps in maintenance of dog, such as time it takes to groom and clean any shedding in residence.
  5) Are you in school or not?
     Asked because this may impact the amount of time an owner has to take care of a dog.
  6) Dog size/under 20 pounds or not?
     Asked because the size of dog impacts the amount of hair shed.
  7) Shedding breed?
     Asked to see if hybrid dog breeds with non-shedding coats are chosen more often.
 
#### Data provenance, quirks in the data, and potential biases:
The goal of this project was to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset. Since there has been a huge increase in hybrid breeding of dogs for non-shedding coats, data was collected about dog owners and their dogs. Surveys were conducted at two Austin area dog parks: Hancock Dog Park and Norwood Estate Dog Park. Responses to six yes or no questions and one apartment versus house question were recorded using the number 1 for yes and the number 2 for no and 1 for apartment and 2 for house. This raw data was recorded in an excel spreadsheet where the seven dog related attributes were identified, as well as indicating which of the two locations the data came from in a column called "Dog Park". The first step in processing this data was to separate the number 1 and number 2 attribute identifiers, then separate the data by dog park location. Next, the percentages of each attribute for the specified location were calculated in order to prepare the CSV file. Using the resulting grouped bar graph a qualitative analysis approach was taken. While there is likely not any quirks in the data, there may be potential biases due to the small sample size.

#### Analysis:
For Hancock Dog Park the majority of pet owners lived in apartments and were their pets only owner while also being a student. It was concluded that the dog owners from the data set representing Hancock Dog Park typically had a smaller dog breed that did not shed. For Norwood Estate Dog Park more than half of the dog owners lived in a home rather than an apartment. Majority of these dog owners were not students and co-owned their pet which was typically a larger breed that shed. The results make sense because maybe pet owners who are students living in an apartment prefer smaller dogs that do not shed. Apartments are smaller than a house and students probably have less time to clean up dog hair.
